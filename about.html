        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p><strong>"Bunga ng Bayan: A Taste of Philippine Exclusive Fruits"</strong> is a digital exhibit highlighting the diverse, rare, and native fruits of the Philippines. This project is a celebration of our agricultural heritage and biodiversity, bringing attention to fruits that are often overlooked in mainstream media and markets.</p>
        <p>Through compelling visuals, rich descriptions, and cultural narratives, we aim to inform and inspire a deeper appreciation for these treasures of the tropics. Whether you're a curious foodie, a student, or simply someone proud of our culture, there's something to discover here.</p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>Many Filipino fruits are rich in nutritional value, adapted to our climate, and deeply woven into our traditions — yet many are slowly being forgotten. By documenting and promoting them, this project contributes to biodiversity conservation and supports local agriculture. More than just food, these fruits are a symbol of identity, heritage, and sustainability.</p>

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p><strong>Bunga ng Bayan</strong> is a student-led initiative that began as a final project with a mission-driven purpose. We believe in the power of storytelling, design, and digital media to educate and influence positive change. Backed by thorough research and cultural sensitivity, we built this platform to make a lasting impact — starting from the classroom, extending to communities, and reaching users online.</p>
