      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Lipote</h2>
      <p>Lipote (Syzygium polycephaloides) is a rare fruit native to the Philippines, closely related to duhat or Java plum. The fruit is small, round, and dark purple to black when ripe, with a mildly sweet and tangy flavor. Lipote trees can grow up to 10 meters tall and are known for their dense foliage and clusters of fruit that grow directly from the trunk or branches, a trait known as cauliflory. Despite its similarity to duhat, Lipote is a distinct species endemic to certain regions in Luzon and Visayas.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Lipote is rich in antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, which help reduce oxidative stress. It also contains vitamin C, fiber, and trace minerals, making it a healthy fruit that supports the immune system and digestive health. Its low-calorie content makes it suitable for people managing their weight or blood sugar levels.</p>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>Lipote holds cultural importance in rural communities, especially in Quezon and Bicol provinces, where it is often turned into jams, jellies, and wine. It is part of local traditions and is sometimes used in religious offerings and community gatherings. Although lesser known, it represents biodiversity and heritage among Philippine fruits.</p>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Though not as commercially cultivated as other fruits, Lipote offers potential for niche markets, especially in organic and artisanal products. Entrepreneurs and small-scale farmers use Lipote for making preserves, wine, and juice, contributing to local livelihood opportunities and promoting lesser-known native species.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Promoting Lipote farming encourages the preservation of indigenous species and biodiversity. Sustainable practices such as community-based agroforestry and organic cultivation are key to maintaining its population. Efforts to document and propagate Lipote help raise awareness of the importance of native fruits in food security and environmental health.</p>
