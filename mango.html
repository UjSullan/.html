      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Mango</h2>
      <p>Mango (<em>Mangifera indica</em>) is the Philippines’ national fruit, celebrated for its sweet, juicy flesh and fragrant aroma. The fruit has smooth skin that varies from green to yellow-orange when ripe. Inside, the succulent flesh surrounds a large flat seed. Mango trees thrive in tropical climates and bear abundant fruit during summer.</p>
