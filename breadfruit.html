      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Breadfruit</h2>
      <p>Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) is a large, round, starchy fruit that grows on a tall tropical tree related to jackfruit. When cooked, its texture resembles bread or potato, hence the name. The fruit has a green, spiky skin and creamy white to yellow flesh. Breadfruit is traditionally grown in tropical regions, including parts of the Philippines, especially in Mindanao and island provinces.</p>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Breadfruit trees are low-maintenance and productive, yielding fruit for decades with minimal inputs. They support reforestation efforts and provide food security due to their adaptability to tropical climates. Promoting breadfruit helps diversify the local food system while preserving native agricultural knowledge.</p>
