      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Alupag</h2>
      <p>Alupag (Dimocarpus didyma) is a rare tropical fruit native to the Philippines, particularly found in Luzon and parts of Mindanao. It resembles the more popular longan, with its rough, leathery skin and translucent, juicy flesh. Alupag grows in clusters and is prized for its sweet, slightly tart taste that refreshes during hot weather. The fruit contains a single dark seed and is best eaten fresh.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Alupag is rich in vitamin C, which helps boost the immune system and improve skin health. It also contains antioxidants and polyphenols that protect the body against free radicals. Its natural sugars provide quick energy, while its fiber content aids digestion. The fruit is low in calories, making it a healthy snack choice.</p>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>Though lesser known than other tropical fruits, Alupag holds cultural value among local communities in the Philippines. It is often shared among family and friends during harvest season and is sometimes preserved in syrups or jams. In folklore, it is considered a symbol of rarity and natural wealth due to its limited availability and short fruiting season.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>While not as commercially prominent as mango or banana, Alupag is sold in local markets and can fetch a high price due to its scarcity. Some small-scale farmers cultivate it for niche markets and eco-tourism. There is growing interest in developing Alupag as a specialty fruit product for both local and potential export markets.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Alupag trees are resilient and can thrive in natural forest settings, making them good candidates for agroforestry. Sustainable practices, such as organic farming and habitat conservation, help maintain healthy tree populations and biodiversity. Promoting Alupag farming encourages the preservation of native fruit species in the Philippines.</p>
