      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Pili Nuts</h2>
      <p>Pili Nuts (<em>Canarium ovatum</em>) are the seeds of the pili tree, native to the Philippines—particularly the Bicol region. Each nut is encased in a hard shell and surrounded by a fleshy pulp when fresh. The edible kernel inside is buttery in texture, with a rich, earthy flavor reminiscent of chestnuts and almonds.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Pili Nuts are high in healthy monounsaturated fats, similar to those in olive oil. They’re also a good source of protein, dietary fiber, magnesium, and vitamin E. These nutrients support heart health, help regulate blood sugar, and provide antioxidant protection.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>In the Bicol region, pili nuts are celebrated as a cultural icon. They appear in festive delicacies such as candied pili, pili brittle, and pili ice cream. The crop is intertwined with local traditions and is often featured in harvest celebrations and culinary fairs.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Pili Nuts form a key livelihood source for smallholder farmers in Bicol. Beyond selling fresh nuts, value‑added products like roasted nuts, spreads, and confections generate income for local enterprises and cooperatives, expanding market reach nationally and abroad.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Pili trees are well‑adapted to local conditions and require minimal chemical inputs, making them ideal for organic and agroforestry systems. Promoting pili cultivation supports biodiversity, soil conservation, and resilient agricultural landscapes in the Philippines.</p>
