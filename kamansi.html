      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Kamansi</h2>
      <p>Kamansi (Artocarpus camansi) is a species of breadfruit native to the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia. It is closely related to the more commonly known breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis). The fruit is round to oval in shape and has a green, spiky rind. When ripe, the flesh is soft, starchy, and yellowish in color. Kamansi is typically cooked before eating, either roasted or boiled, and is often used in both savory dishes and desserts.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Kamansi is a good source of carbohydrates and fiber, making it an excellent energy-boosting food. It is also rich in vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, potassium, and magnesium. The fruit has been traditionally used as a staple food in rural areas, especially in times of food scarcity. Its high fiber content aids in digestion and supports overall gut health.</p>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>In the Philippines, Kamansi is considered an important part of local cuisine, especially in provinces like Leyte and Samar. The fruit is often cooked in stews and added to soups, making it a popular choice for traditional Filipino dishes. Kamansi is also culturally significant as a symbol of sustenance, particularly in rural communities.</p>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Kamansi, like its cousin the breadfruit, plays an important role in the economy of rural areas, particularly in the Philippines. Though not as commercially cultivated as other fruits, it provides supplemental income for small-scale farmers who grow the trees for their fruit. Additionally, Kamansi is increasingly gaining attention in niche markets for its use in local food products and sustainable farming practices.</p>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Kamansi trees are hardy and can thrive in various soil types with minimal maintenance. They are particularly useful for agroforestry and sustainable farming practices, as their deep root systems help prevent soil erosion. By promoting Kamansi cultivation, communities can enhance biodiversity, protect local ecosystems, and provide a sustainable source of food and income.</p>
