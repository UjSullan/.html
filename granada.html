      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Granada</h2>
      <p>Granada, or pomegranate (Punica granatum), is a round fruit with a tough outer rind and jewel-like seeds called arils inside. While more commonly associated with the Mediterranean and Middle East, it can be grown in tropical areas of the Philippines. The arils are juicy, sweet-tart, and rich in flavor, surrounding small edible seeds.</p>
