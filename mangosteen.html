      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Mangosteen</h2>
      <p>Mangosteen (<em>Garcinia mangostana</em>) is a tropical evergreen fruit native to Southeast Asia. It has a thick, purple rind and segmented, white flesh that is juicy, sweet, and slightly acidic. The rind contains xanthones, a type of antioxidant. Mangosteen trees thrive in humid, tropical climates and bear fruit seasonally.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Mangosteen is rich in vitamin C, dietary fiber, and powerful antioxidants called xanthones, which may support anti-inflammatory and immune‑boosting effects. It also provides small amounts of B‑vitamins and minerals like magnesium and manganese.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>Known as the “Queen of Fruits,” mangosteen is prized in Filipino desserts and beverages. Its exotic sweetness features in local specialties like ice creams, jams, and refreshing juices. It symbolizes luxury and tropical abundance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>While not as widely cultivated as other fruits, mangosteen commands premium prices in domestic and international markets. Small farmers and cooperatives benefit from its high market value, especially when exporting to health‑food and specialty fruit sectors.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Mangosteen trees require organic, well‑drained soils and shaded conditions. Promoting agroforestry systems and organic cultivation preserves biodiversity and reduces chemical use. Sustainable mangosteen growing supports long‑term ecosystem health.</p>
