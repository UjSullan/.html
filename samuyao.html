      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Samuyao</h2>
      <p>Samuyao (Citrus micrantha), also known as biasong or small wild lime, is a rare citrus fruit native to the Philippines, particularly found in Mindanao and parts of the Visayas. It is a tiny, highly aromatic fruit, with a strong citrus scent and a bitter, tangy taste. The fruit is greenish-yellow when ripe and contains very little pulp. Despite its size, Samuyao is packed with essential oils, especially in its rind, and is often used more for its zest than for its juice.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Samuyao is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, which help boost the immune system and reduce inflammation. Its essential oils are known for antimicrobial properties, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine to relieve cough, colds, and digestive issues. It is also a natural flavor enhancer in culinary preparations.</p>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>In many Visayan and Mindanaoan households, Samuyao plays a role in local dishes and food traditions. Its peel is often used to season dishes like kinilaw (Filipino ceviche) or as a natural perfume due to its strong citrus aroma. It reflects the ingenuity of Filipino cooking by using locally available fruits and herbs to enhance flavor and wellness.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>While not widely cultivated for commercial agriculture, Samuyao has growing potential in the niche markets of essential oils, organic condiments, and natural health products. Communities practicing small-scale agroforestry have started to integrate Samuyao trees, supporting local economic activities and sustainable farming techniques.</p>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Preserving native citrus species like Samuyao supports biodiversity and ecological balance. Encouraging the propagation of Samuyao contributes to climate-resilient farming and promotes the use of indigenous resources. Conservation efforts also ensure the fruitâ€™s availability for future generations and protect cultural heritage tied to its use.</p>
