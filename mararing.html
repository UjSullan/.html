      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Marang</h2>
      <p>Marang (<em>Artocarpus odoratissimus</em>), also called tarap, is a close relative of jackfruit and breadfruit. It has a spiny green rind which splits open to reveal creamy-white segments of soft, custard‑like flesh. The aroma is sweet and distinctive, and each fruit yields multiple edible bulbs attached to a central core.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Marang is rich in carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and vitamin C, supporting healthy digestion and immune function. It also provides B‑vitamins (B1, B2, B3) for energy metabolism, potassium for heart health, and natural antioxidants that help reduce oxidative stress.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>In Mindanao and other southern Philippine regions, marang is a prized seasonal delicacy. Families share the fruit at harvest time, and it features in local fiestas and markets. Its fleeting availability makes it a symbol of abundance and celebration.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Though less commercialized than jackfruit or durian, marang supports smallholder farmers who sell fresh fruit in local markets and by the roadside. Its unique flavor attracts specialty buyers, and there is growing interest in processed forms—jam, ice cream, and dried snacks.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Marang trees are well‑adapted to humid tropical climates and can be grown in mixed agroforestry systems. Promoting organic cultivation and protecting wild populations helps conserve genetic diversity. Encouraging sustainable harvesting practices ensures marang remains part of regional food security and biodiversity.</p>
