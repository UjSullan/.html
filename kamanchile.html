      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Kamanchile</h2>
      <p>Kamanchile (Pithecellobium dulce), commonly known as Manila tamarind, is a small tree native to the Americas but widely naturalized in the Philippines. Its fruit pods contain sweet-sour pulp surrounding hard seeds. The pods are curved and dark brown when ripe; inside, the pulp is pale pink to white, with a crisp, juicy texture.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Kamanchile pulp is low in calories and rich in vitamin C, dietary fiber, and antioxidants. It aids digestion, supports immune health, and provides hydration. Traditional uses include using the pulp as a mild diuretic and appetizer stimulant.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>In many Filipino neighborhoods, Kamanchile trees line streets and yards. Children often snack on fresh pods, and its sweet-sour taste is a nostalgic flavor of summer. Folk medicine also employs various parts of the tree for cough remedies and topical treatments.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>While not a large-scale commercial crop, Kamanchile provides supplemental income to rural households through local sales of fresh pods or homemade preserves. Its hardy nature makes it a low-input crop for agroforestry and homestead gardens.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Kamanchile trees thrive in poor soils and require minimal care, making them ideal for sustainable reforestation and erosion control. Promoting their cultivation enhances urban and rural green cover, supports biodiversity, and preserves a familiar, culturally important species.</p>
