      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Pulasan</h2>
      <p>Pulasan (<em>Nephelium mutabile</em>) is a tropical fruit closely related to rambutan and lychee, native to Southeast Asia. Its thick, red rind is studded with short, soft spines; inside are translucent, juicy segments encasing a seed. The flesh is sweet and aromatic, often described as richer and creamier than rambutan.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Pulasan is rich in vitamin C, dietary fiber, and antioxidants such as flavonoids. It supports immune function, aids digestion, and helps combat oxidative stress. The fruit’s high water content also makes it hydrating and refreshing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>Though less widespread than its cousins, pulasan is prized in regions where it grows—particularly in Sabah, Malaysia, and parts of Indonesia. In the Philippines it remains a niche fruit, enjoyed by enthusiasts and featured at local fruit fairs and tropical fruit tastings.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Pulasan commands premium prices in specialty markets due to its limited availability and unique flavor. Small growers cultivate it for direct sale to local markets and upscale grocery outlets. Artisanal products—like pulasan jams and desserts—are emerging as boutique offerings.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Pulasan trees thrive in low‑impact, agroforestry systems alongside other tropical species. Their moderate shade tolerance and pest resistance make them suitable for sustainable, organic cultivation. Promoting pulasan supports biodiversity and helps preserve heirloom fruit varieties.</p>
