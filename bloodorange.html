      <h2>1. Exploring the Internal Profile of Blood Orange</h2>
      <p>Blood orange (<em>Citrus × sinensis</em> 'Moro' or 'Tarocco') is a unique citrus cultivar distinguished by its deep red to maroon flesh. The rind often has a blush of red as well. Its flavor combines the sweetness of a traditional orange with subtle raspberry-like notes. Blood orange trees thrive in warm, Mediterranean-like climates and produce fruit seasonally in late winter to spring.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>2. Dietary Benefits and Nutritional Values</h2>
      <p>Blood oranges are high in vitamin C, fiber, and unique antioxidants called anthocyanins, which give the flesh its characteristic color. These compounds support immune function, reduce inflammation, and promote cardiovascular health. They also provide folate and potassium.</p>

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>3. Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>While native to the Mediterranean region, blood oranges have been adopted in Philippine horticulture. They appear in salads, desserts, and refreshing beverages, lending their dramatic color and flavor. In culinary circles, they symbolize gourmet citrus and seasonal elegance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>4. Economic Contributions</h2>
      <p>Blood oranges command premium prices in specialty fruit markets and foodservice. Small growers and boutique farms benefit from their status as a high‑value crop. Processing into artisanal marmalades, syrups, and cocktails further adds economic opportunity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Blood orange cultivation fits well into diversified orchard systems. Their seasonal nature encourages staggered harvests, reducing pressure on labor and logistics. Integrating blood orange with other citrus and native trees supports biodiversity and sustainable land use.</p>
